ROS adapter for the EPFL Ranger robot
=====================================

This ROS package provides:

- a set of launch files suitable to create maps or drive around the robot
  (assuming a 3D depth sensor)
- a node (`ros_interface`) that expose standard ROS topics for the robot
  (odometry as `odom` and the TF transformation for `base_link`)
